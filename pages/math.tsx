plus sign: + / addition sign: +
The plus sign represents:

a. the notion of positive
Any number bigger than zero is a positive number and can be written with or without a plus sign in front of it.

Thus, +5 (plus five) and 5 (five) are the same number.

b. the operation of addition
3 + 5 = 8
three plus five equals eight
five added to three makes eight
three added to five makes eight
if you add five to three you get eight

Addition gives us a sum. In 3 + 5 = 8, the sum is eight.

minus sign: - / subtraction sign: - 
The minus sign represents:

a. the notion of negative
Any number smaller than zero is a negative number and must be written with a minus sign in front of it.

Thus, -5 (minus five) is not the same number as 5 (positive five).

b. the operation of subtraction
3 - 5 = -2
three minus five equals negative two
five subtracted from three makes negative two
three subtracted from five makes negative two

The equal sign represents:

a. the notion of equality
If two numbers have the same value, we say that they are equal.

Thus, 3 = 3 (three equals three) and 8 = 8 (eight equals eight) are both true statements.

b. the operation of equality
If two numbers have the same value, then the result of any operation performed on them is also equal to that value.

Thus, 3 + 5 = 8 (three plus five equals eight) and 3 - 5 = -2 (three minus five equals negative two) are both true statements.
